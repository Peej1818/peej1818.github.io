I'm interested in investigating how **principles from social cognition inform how people interact with robots**.

Through these investigations, I aim to **endow robots with models of human cognition** that capture human inferences about a robot's knowledge and abilities.

I believe such models will make interactions with robots **fluid, intuitive, and all together more helpful for people.**
