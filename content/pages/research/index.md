These days, I investigate ways robot learners can help people become
**[efficacious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficacious)** teachers of
skills and personal preferences. In particular, I work on ways to:

  1. **model misunderstandings** that learners and teachers have of each other, and
  1. incorporate such models into the robot's **reasoning and feedback generation processes**.

Ideally, my work will **reduce cognitive demands** placed upon human teachers
**without sacrificing the interpretability** of the robot's internal models.
