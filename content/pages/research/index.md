These days, I'm especially interested in figuring out how robot learners can help
make people more **[efficacious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/efficacious)**
teachers of skills and personal preferences. In particular, I am working on ways to:

  1. **model misunderstandings** that learners and teachers have of each other, and
  1. incorporate such models into the robot's **reasoning and feedback generation processes**.

Ideally, my work will **reduce cognitive demands** placed upon human
teachers **without sacrificing the interpretability** of the robot's internal
models.
