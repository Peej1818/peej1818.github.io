I'm a PhD student in the [Robotics Institute](https://ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University where
I'm lucky to be advised by two stellar people: Professors [Henny Admoni]("https://www.hennyadmoni.com")
and [Reid Simmons](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~reids/).

Prior to becoming a PhD student, I was a Master's student in the RI. During that time, I was happily
advised by Professors Admoni and [Oliver Kroemer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/).

Before enrolling at CMU, I worked on the navigation and planning software for
[MoonRanger](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/moonranger/) under Professors Red Whittaker and David Wettergreen,
and I also worked on the [Iris](https://irislunarrover.space/) (originally
[CubeRover](https://tinyurl.com/28kdyznf)) project's Systems Engineering team. Before robotics, I
taught 9th grade Humanities and coached boys' lacrosse and ice hockey at Culver Academies. I earned
a dual degree in English and Economics from the University of Virginia.
